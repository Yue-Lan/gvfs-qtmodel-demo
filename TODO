====
* add file monitor for file changes.
* add more infomation to provide over one columns for tree view.
* if needed, add interaction dialog (implement GMountOperation) when loading children for a volume (maybe sftp:///, etc), and consider blocking ui.
* consider wether there is a way to free the collapsed tree item's children without custom view help (maybe no way).
* sort internal? or use sort/filter proxy model?
